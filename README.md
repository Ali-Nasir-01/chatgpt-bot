# ChatGPT Telegram Bot - Node.js

This is a Telegram bot for interacting with a large language model trained by OpenAI. It enables users to interact with the ChatGPT AI in natural language and receive responses in real time.

The idea of this bot is to provide an easy to use interface for people who want to experiment with conversational AI. With this bot, you can ask any question that you have in mind and get an answer.

Also, this bot can join telegram groups and if mentioned answer your questions.

To use it you have two options:

- If you just want to use ChatGPT you can search for ```@TextChatGPTBot``` in telegram and start to use it.

- Second, if you want to have your own bot easily you can clone this project and add a ```.env``` file with these states on it:
    ```
    TELEGRAM_TOKEN="Your telegram bot token"
    BOT_USERNAME="@your_bot_username"
    CHATGPT_TOKEN="Your ChatGPT token"
    ```
    and after that just run ```npm i``` and ```npm start``` in your command line.

This project will become more complete soon
